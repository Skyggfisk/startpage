# Startpage
Startpage is a the simple concept of a custom home page for your browser. The idea is to be able to display a few interesting items, such as weather, an RSS feed, and favorite links, whenever the home tab is opened.
## Origin
Idea originally from 4chan's technology board, a thread were people encourage people new to web development to create a simple, but useful and beautiful page to their liking, without the need for knowledge about hosting, advanced libraries/frameworks, or build systems.

Currently hosting this page on [skyggfisk.github.io](skyggfisk.github.io/startpage/).
