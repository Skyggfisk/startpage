# Startpage
Startpage is the simple concept of a custom home page for your browser. The idea is to be able to display some items of interest, such as weather, a news feed, bookmarks, or some cool little creation whenever the home tab is opened.

## Origin
Idea originally from 4chan's technology board /g/, in /wdg/ web development general; a thread were people encourage people new to web development to create a simple, but useful and beautiful page to their liking, without the need for knowledge about hosting, advanced libraries/frameworks, or build systems.

Currently hosting this page on [skyggfisk.github.io/startpage/](https://skyggfisk.github.io/startpage/).
