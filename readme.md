# Startpage
Startpage is the simple concept of a custom home page for your browser. The idea is to be able to display some items of interest to them, such as weather, an news feed, bookmarks, or some cool little creation whenever the home tab is opened.
## Origin
Idea originally from 4chan's technology board /g/, in /wdg/ web development general; a thread were people encourage people new to web development to create a simple, but useful and beautiful page to their liking, without the need for knowledge about hosting, advanced libraries/frameworks, or build systems.

Currently hosting this page on [skyggfisk.github.io](skyggfisk.github.io/startpage/).
